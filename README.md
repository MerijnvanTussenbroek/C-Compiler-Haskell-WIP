# C_compiler_Haskell

This is a C "compiler" made completely in Haskell. This is able to lex and parse a subset of C and then either convert it to Assembly, visualize the AST of the code, or evaluate it to its eventual endstate.

The parser library was ispired by the uu-tc library available on gitlab
