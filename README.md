# C_compiler_Haskell

This is a C "compiler" made completely in Haskell. This is able to lex and parse a subset of C and then either convert it to a self-made "assembly" language that can run on the virtual machine.

The parser library was ispired by the uu-tc library available on gitlab

I might add onto this project later, but for now I am finished.
